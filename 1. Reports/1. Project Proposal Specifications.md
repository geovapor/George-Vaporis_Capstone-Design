## Introduction - Landon

The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


## Formulating the Problem - Parker + Alec

Formulating the problem or objective involves clearly defining it through background information, specifications, and constraints. Think of it as "fencing in" the objective to make it unambiguously clear what is and is not being addressed and why.

Questions to consider:
- Who does the problem affect (i.e. who is your customer)? 
    This solution targets owners of electric golf carts who wish to supplement their vehicle’s power supply through solar energy, eliminating dependence on traditional outlet-based charging. The intended customer is any electric golf cart owner seeking a more autonomous and flexible charging solution.
  
- Why do we need this solution? 
    This solution addresses a critical gap in usability – when a golf cart’s battery is depleted during active use and no electrical outlet is accessible, the vehicle becomes inoperable. By integrating a solar charging panel, the cart can passively recharge while stationary and exposed to sunlight, extending operational range and reducing downtime without requiring access to traditional charging infrastructure.
  
- What challenges necessitate a dedicated, multi-person engineering team?   
    Several factors make a multi-person engineering team essential. First, safety oversight cannot be managed by a single individual who is simultaneously performing hands-on-testing – a dedicated team member should always monitor for hazards. Second, the system comprises multiple distinct subsystems, each requiring specialized technical knowledge that no single engineer is likely to possess across all areas. Third, live testing demands the simultaneous collection of data across multiple points in the system, which is physically impossible for one person to manage alone.
  
- Why aren’t off-the-shelf solutions sufficient? 
    While prior attempts have been made to develop a comparable solution, none have proven successful or reliable. Existing commercial products lack the specific compatibility, performance validation, and system integration required for this application, making a purpose-built, thoroughly tested solution necessary. 

### Background

**Provide context and details necessary to define the problem clearly and delineate its boundaries.**
#### Customer
This project's primary customer is Lani Solar, LLC (LaniEV). LaniEV is developing a line of standardized retrofit conversion kits for low-speed electric vehicles (LSVs), personal transport vehicles (PVTs),  and golf cars. These retrofit kits replace the legacy lead-acid battery with a LiFePO₄ (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery bank integrated with a self-charging roof solar panel. The goal is to commercialize the conversion kits for entire fleet conversions. Secondary stakeholders include Tennessee Technological University (TTU), as the owner of the control golf car used for the project, and as the ensuring agency for documented safety, reliability, and performance data. Dr. Christopher Storm Johnson is responsible, as the capstone instructor, for evaluating team performance and ensuring the project's desired end-state is reached. Prospective fleet operators and other consumers of the retrofit kit would depend heavily on the testing and evaluations done on the product. 

#### Problem
Legacy golf cars continue to utilize lead-acid battery systems due to their well-documented electrical performance and broad availability. These systems present constraints such as low energy density, volume constraints, short lifecycle, load limits, maintenance requirements, and environmental concerns. These limitations increase cost and decrease sustainability for large-scale applications. Alternative power systems, such as LiFePO₄ batteries integrated with solar charging, could potentially address the limitations inherent in the lead-acid batteries. The growing interest in alternative systems demands formal documentation for conversion processes. The lack of validation prevents large-scale migration of LSV, PVT, and golf car platforms to alternative energy systems.

#### Solution 
Meticulous examination and documentation of the conversion process shall establish a validated framework for implementing the standardized retrofit kit. The development includes initial state characterization of the existing lead-acid system, formalization of the conversion methodology, post-conversion performance evaluation, and a quantified analysis of environmental and economic impact. The Tennessee Tech University Club Car shall serve as the control platform for this process. Baseline electrical and functional characteristics of the legacy system shall be documented prior to conversion. Following installation of the LiFePO₄ battery and solar charging systems, the vehicle shall undergo structured testing to quantify energy efficiency, power delivery, charging behavior, and operational performance. The resulting documentation shall provide the necessary metrics required for the retrofit kit to be commercialized. 

#### Challenges
The transition from a legacy lead-acid battery system to a LiFePO₄ solar-integrated architecture introduces several technical challenges that require analysis and validation. Power system analysis is required to ensure electrical compatibility between the new battery management system, solar charge component, and existing drivetrain components. Reliable baseline and post-conversion measurements require appropriate instrumentation and data acquisition to produce a repeatable performance comparison. System modeling is necessary to interpret data and support cost and environmental impact projections. In addition, testing and documentation must be developed to establish a repeatable retrofit framework rather than an installation-specific modification.

#### Alternatives
The response to lead-acid battery degradation in golf cars has been, primarily, to replace the old battery with a new lead-acid battery. This approach minimizes integration complexity but does not address limitations related to energy density, cycle life, or environmental impact. A secondary alternative involves replacing the lead-acid battery bank with a LiFePO₄ system while preserving the grid-based charging. Although this method reduces maintenance requirements, it does not incorporate renewable energy or provide documented lifecycle comparisons. A less compact solution, still matching the footprint of the retrofit kit, would be the construction of a solar farm to fuel charging stations for golf cars. While a solar farm is less effective for small vehicles, it allows for more diverse applications of solar energy. Additional alternatives include full vehicle replacement or commercially available conversion kits. However, these options often lack formally documented integration procedures, validated performance data, and/or economic or environmental lifecycle analysis.

### Specifications and Constraints

Specifications and constraints define the system's requirements. They can be positive (do this) or negative (don't do that). They can be mandatory (shall or must) or optional (may). They can cover performance, accuracy, interfaces, or limitations. Regardless of their origin, they must be unambiguous and impose measurable requirements.

#### Specifications

Specifications are requirements imposed by **stakeholders** to meet their needs. If a specification seems unattainable, it is necessary to discuss and negotiate with the stakeholders.

#### Constraints

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders.

Questions to consider:
- Do governing bodies regulate the solution in any way? 
    Yes, there are sever regulatory bodies that may govern aspects of this solution. The National Electrical Code, Particular Artical 690, sets standards for solar photovoltaic systems and would apply to the electrical integration of the solar panel and charge controller.UL Additionally, if the golf car is intended for use on public roads or pathways, local Department of Motor Vehicles regulations or municipal ordinances may apply. OSHA regulations would also govern safe practices during live testing and assembly to protect team members working with electrical systems.
  
- Are there industrial standards that need to be considered and followed? 
    Several industrial standards are relevent to this project. IEEE standards for battery charging systems provided guidance on safe and efficient energy transfer to lead-acid or lithium-ion battery packs commony found in electric golf carts. ICE 61215 and ICE 61730 cover the performance and safty requirements for photovoltaic modules ensuring the solar panael slected meets durability and output reliability benchmarks. SAE Internation standsrds may also apply regarding the electrical integration of auxiliary power systems into electric vehicales. Adhering to these standards ensures the system performs predictably and safely across varing environmental conditions.
  
- What impact will the engineering, manufacturing, or final product have on public health, safety, and welfare? 
    The engineering and testing phases carry inherent electrical hazards, including rish of shock, short circuit or thermal runwawy in battery systems, which is preciwsely why the project requires a dedicated safety monitor during live testing. The final product,however, has a net positive impact on public safety and welfare by reducing reliance on grid-base charging infrastructure and eleiminating the risk of a stranded,inoperable car in environments where help may not be readily available, such as large private properties, agriculture lands, or remote recrational areas. From a welfare standpoint, increased vehicle autonomy inproves accessibility for users who do not have convenient access to electical outlets. Manufacturing considerations should include responsible sourcing of photovoltaic materials and proper disposal protocols for battery components to minimize environmental health risk.
  
- Are there global, cultural, social, environmental, or economic factors that must be considered? 
    Environmentally, solar integration directly reduces the carbhon footpront associated with golf cars operation by decreasing dependence on grid electricity, which in many regions is still partially generated from fossil fuels. This aligns with broader global sustainability goals and growing demand for clean energy alternatives. Economically, while the upfront cost of solar components represents an added investment, the long term reduction in electricity costs and increased operational flexibility offer a compelling return on investment,particularly for users in high-sunlight regions. Socially, this solution democratizes access to reliable electric transportation in areas lacking adequate electrical infrastructure, which has meaningful implications in rural or developing communities where golf carts serve practical transportation roles beyond recreation. Culturally, the growing acceptance of solar technology and green energy solutions means this product aligns well with current consumer values and expectations around sustainability.


## Survey of Existing Solutions - Nathan

Research existing solutions, whether in literature, on the market, or within the industry. Present these findings in a coherent, organized manner. Remember to cite all information that is not common knowledge.

#### 1. Charging Methods for Electric Golf Carts
Existing solutions for solar powered golf carts primarily serve as supplementary energy sources rather than full standalone power generation systems. Research in the field acknowledges the development of solar powered electric cart systems, but these implementations typically supplement battery energy and extend the usable range [1]. For example, rooftop solar panels on electric golf carts augment traditional battery charging, prolonging operational time under sunny conditions, but they do not eliminate the need for grid based or primary battery charging [2], [3].
Another established charging method is regenerative braking, which recovers kinetic energy during deceleration and downhill operation. This system converts energy that would otherwise be dissipated as heat into electrical energy stored in the battery. In many modern low cost golf carts, regenerative braking is integrated to improve overall energy efficiency, particularly in stop and go scenarios or on hilly golf courses. The technology can recover 5–15% of energy in typical operating conditions, thereby extending range and reducing charging frequency [4].
Solar Panel Efficiency Comparisons Solar panel efficiency is critical for golf cart applications due to limited mounting area (typically on the roof) and variable sunlight exposure during use. Higher efficiency panels generate more power per unit area, making them preferable for extending battery life or range without oversized installations.
Commercial solar panel efficiencies in 2025–2026 vary by technology type. Monocrystalline panels (often with PERC, TOPCon, or heterojunction enhancements) lead in efficiency for space constrained uses like golf carts. Thin film options (e.g., CIGS or CdTe) offer flexibility and lighter weight but lower efficiency, suiting curved or portable setups. Bifacial panels can provide extra gain from reflected light but require appropriate mounting height and surface albedo (less ideal for flat golf cart roofs). Polycrystalline panels are largely discontinued in new production due to inferior performance [6], [7], [8].
The following table summarizes typical commercial module efficiencies (2025–2026 data):
 
| Solar Panel Type | Typical Efficiency Range | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Monocrystalline |	20–24% | Highest output per area,excellent in partial sun,durable |	Higher cost, rigid versions heavier |
| Bifacial | 21–24% | Potential extra yield on reflective surfaces | Rear gain limited on golf cart roof, heavier |
| Thin-Film (CIGS) | 15–18% | Lightweight, flexible, good for curved roofs | Lower efficiency, needs more area |
| Thin-Film (CdTe) | 18–19%	| Cost-effective thin film, performs in heat | Moderate efficiency, toxicity concerns |
| Polycrystalline |	15–18% | Low cost |	Lowest efficiency, phased out |

For golf carts, monocrystalline panels with efficiencies above 20% are recommended to achieve meaningful supplementation (e.g., 100–300 W systems generating 0.5–1.5 kWh/day in sunny conditions) [5], [10]. Flexible monocrystalline options balance efficiency and weight for roof mounting.
#### 2. Batteries
Electric golf carts predominantly use two main battery types: lead acid and lithium ion (specifically lithium iron phosphate, LiFePO4).
Lead acid batteries remain the most common due to their low cost and include three subtypes: flooded, gel, and absorbed glass mat (AGM). Flooded lead-acid batteries are the most affordable and widely used in golf carts, but they require regular maintenance such as checking water levels and cleaning terminals [11]. Gel batteries feature a silica-based gel electrolyte, providing excellent deep cycle performance, resistance to extreme temperatures, and maintenance-free operation, though they are more expensive and have specific charging needs [11]. AGM batteries use fiberglass mats to absorb the electrolyte, making them spill-proof, vibration-resistant, and lower maintenance than flooded types while offering similar sealed advantages [11].
Lithium ion (LiFePO4) batteries represent a newer, higher-performance option. They offer greater stability, safety, significantly longer cycle life, and zero maintenance compared to lead acid batteries, albeit at a higher upfront cost [11].
Battery Comparison The table below provides a concise 2026 comparison of the main golf cart battery types (full set for typical 48V system):

| Battery Type | Full Set Cost (2026) | Lifespan | Charge Time | Maintenance |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Flooded Lead-Acid | $800–$1,500 | 4–6 years | 8–12 hrs | High |
| Gel Lead-Acid | $1,000–$1,800 | 5–7 years | 8–10 hrs | Low |
| AGM Lead-Acid | $1,200–$2,000 | 5–7 years | 6–8 hrs | Low |
| Lithium (LiFePO4) | $2,000–$5,000 | 10–20 years | 2–4 hrs | None |

Lithium batteries excel in longevity, weight savings (improving cart efficiency), fast charging, and full usable capacity, often providing better long term value despite higher initial cost [11], [12].
#### 3. Other Applications That May Be Implemented
Additional features can enhance golf cart usability and user experience on the course. These include heated and cooled seats to improve comfort during extreme weather conditions, electronic scorecards to eliminate issues with lost pencils or wind-blown paper scorecards, integrated fans for cooling during hot summer play, and an auto caddy GPS based system that measures distance to the hole and recommends club selections, particularly beneficial for beginner golfers.

## Specific Implications - Alec

**Explain the implications of solving the problem for the customer. After reading this section, the reader should understand the tangible benefits and the worthiness of the proposed work.**
- The document must explain how the customer will benefit from the solution.

This project provides LaniEV with a documented application of their retrofit kit for an existing electric Club Car. It also serves as a reference for future evaluations or conversions of similar golf cars by documenting the pre-conversion features of the TTU Club Car and following a structured conversion process. Documentation of the conversion includes battery removal, LiFePO₄ installation, wiring changes, and solar roof installation. This establishes standard procedures that support large-scale conversions. The project includes analysis of energy use, charging behavior, and "fill versus drain" rates. This verified data allows for an objective comparison between old lead-acid systems and the LiFePO₄ solar-integrated system. The resulting performance metrics enhance product credibility and support its large-scale adoption. 

The project also gives LaniEV an analysis of environmental and economic impacts. Comparisons between the pre-conversion and post-conversion golf cars will highlight measurable differences like landfill waste, stress on the electrical grid, carbon footprint, and return on investment. The findings from these comparisons could apply to larger fleet adoption and improve LaniEV's chances of engaging big organizations. Overall, the project builds the technical analysis required for new electric technology and provides LaniEV with an honest, analytical assessment of the retrofit kit.
