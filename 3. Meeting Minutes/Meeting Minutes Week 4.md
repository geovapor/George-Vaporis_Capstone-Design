**[Notes]**

- Looked over each person's section and gave constructive feedback

**After Class Meeting with Dr.Storm Notes:**

- Budget does not have to be exact, it can be a rough estimate

- When writing the Project Proposal, we can write like we are part of
  LaniEV and not just a group of students from TTU doing research for
  them

- Perspective is not strict, it can be flexible depending on the section
